Hi!

Nice to be on the *Intro course on Open Data Science*. I work in risk 
management field in insurance business. I have studied applied 
mathematics and statistics in *University of Helsinki* some 10 years ago. 
I expect to learn some basics about the open data science. 
I found this course at the Mooc courses page. 

Looking forward to learn more about **R**, and my goal is to study
more **R** statiscs so I'm albe to use it in my work also, and perhaps also as a
hobby! :D So starting with happy feelings, but in a some hurry to finish first
